# Spaghetti Carbonara Recipe

## Ingredients
- 400g spaghetti
- 150g pancetta or guanciale, diced
- 4 large eggs
- 100g Parmesan cheese, grated
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- Parsley, chopped (optional, for garnish)

## Instructions
1. **Prepare the Sauce**: In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs and Parmesan cheese until well combined. Season with a generous amount of black pepper. Set aside.

2. **Cook the Pasta**: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook until al dente, about 8-10 minutes. Reserve 1 cup of the pasta water, then drain the pasta.

3. **Cook Pancetta**: In a large pan over medium heat, heat the olive oil. Add the pancetta and cook until golden and crisp, about 4-5 minutes. Turn off the heat and add garlic, stirring until fragrant, about 1 minute.

4. **Combine**: Add the hot, drained spaghetti into the pan with the pancetta and garlic. Toss well to coat the pasta.

5. **Make Carbonara**: Pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta, quickly tossing to combine. The heat from the pasta should cook the eggs without scrambling them. If the sauce is too thick, add reserved pasta water a little at a time until you reach the desired consistency.

6. **Season and Serve**: Season with a pinch of salt and more black pepper to taste. Top with additional grated Parmesan and chopped parsley if desired.
